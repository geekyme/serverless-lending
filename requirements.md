# Technical Design Document: Serverless Loan Origination and Management System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design for a serverless Loan Origination System (LOS) and Loan Management System (LMS) using AWS services. The system is designed to handle the entire loan lifecycle for Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs), from initial application to final repayment or closure, in a scalable and efficient manner.

## 2. Overall System Architecture

The combined LOS and LMS is built using a serverless architecture, primarily leveraging AWS services:

- AWS Lambda for compute
- Amazon API Gateway for API management
- Amazon DynamoDB for database storage
- Amazon S3 for document storage
- AWS Step Functions for workflow orchestration
- Amazon SNS for notifications
- Amazon EventBridge for scheduling and triggering time-based events
- AWS Batch for bulk processing tasks
- Amazon Athena and QuickSight for reporting and analytics

  4. Process payments through appropriate providers as defined in 4.1.2

- Workflow for updating loan status post-payment:
  1. Receive payment confirmation from Payment Processing Engine
  2. Trigger a Lambda function to update loan status
  3. Retrieve current loan details from DynamoDB
  4. Apply payment to outstanding balance, allocating to fees, interest, and principal
  5. Recalculate days overdue based on remaining balance
  6. Update loan status:
     - If balance is fully paid and no overdue amount remains, set status to "Current"
     - If balance is partially paid, update delinquency status based on remaining overdue amount and days
  7. Store transaction details and updated loan status in DynamoDB
  8. Trigger notifications to borrower and relevant internal teams

##### 4.1.4.5 Loan Modification as Part of Collection Strategy

- Implement a Step Function workflow for loan modifications:

  1. Receive modification request (from borrower or suggested by collection agent)
  2. Evaluate request based on predefined criteria and current loan status
  3. If approved, calculate new loan terms
  4. Generate modification agreement
  5. Update loan records in DynamoDB
  6. Notify relevant parties (borrower, collection agent, loan officers)

- Types of modifications supported:

  - Term extensions
  - Interest rate adjustments
  - Payment frequency changes
  - Temporary payment reductions or suspensions (forbearance)
  - Restructured payment plans

- Integration with collection process:
  - Allow collection agents to initiate or recommend loan modifications
  - Use loan modification as a tool to help borrowers become current on their loans
  - Update delinquency status based on agreed modifications

##### 4.1.4.6 Collection Agent Interface

- Enhance the web interface for collection agents to:
  - View assigned delinquent accounts
  - Log communication attempts and outcomes
  - Initiate payment requests on behalf of borrowers (redirecting to the unified payment portal)
  - Propose and initiate loan modifications
  - Update account notes and status
  - Escalate accounts for legal action if necessary

##### 4.1.4.7 Reporting and Analytics

- Generate daily, weekly, and monthly collection and modification reports
- Provide dashboards for collection performance metrics, including the effectiveness of loan modifications in resolving delinquencies
- Implement predictive analytics to identify high-risk accounts and suggest proactive modification strategies

## 5. Integration and Shared Considerations

### 5.1 Integration Points

1. **LOS to LMS Handoff**:

   - Trigger: Loan approval and disbursement
   - Action: Create Loan Account in LMS

2. **Payment Gateway Integration**:

   - Purpose: Process electronic payments
   - Technology: API integration with payment service provider

3. **Credit Bureau Reporting**:

   - Purpose: Report loan performance to credit bureaus
   - Frequency: Monthly or as required by regulations

4. **General Ledger Integration**:
   - Purpose: Sync financial transactions with accounting system
   - Technology: Batch process or real-time API calls

### 5.2 Security Considerations

1. Implement fine-grained access controls using AWS IAM
2. Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AWS KMS
3. Use AWS WAF to protect APIs from common web exploits
4. Implement multi-factor authentication for administrative access
5. Regularly audit and rotate access keys and credentials

### 5.3 Monitoring and Alerting

1. Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring Lambda functions, APIs, and databases
2. Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., payment processing failures, system errors)
3. Implement custom metrics for business-specific KPIs (e.g., delinquency rates, processing times)
4. Use AWS X-Ray for tracing and debugging distributed applications

### 5.4 Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

1. Implement multi-region deployment for critical components
2. Set up DynamoDB global tables for data replication
3. Use S3 cross-region replication for document storage
4. Develop and regularly test disaster recovery procedures
5. Implement automated failover mechanisms where possible

### 5.5 Performance Optimization

1. Implement DynamoDB auto-scaling
2. Use AWS Lambda provisioned concurrency for consistently fast performance
3. Implement caching strategies using Amazon ElastiCache
4. Optimize database queries and indexes
5. Use AWS Step Functions for coordinating complex, long-running processes

### 5.6 Compliance and Audit

1. Implement comprehensive logging using AWS CloudTrail
2. Use Amazon Macie for sensitive data discovery and protection
3. Implement a retention policy for loan documents and transaction records
4. Develop processes for responding to audit requests and regulatory inquiries
5. Regularly review and update security policies and procedures

## 6. Deployment Strategy

- Use the Serverless Framework for defining and deploying AWS resources
- Key aspects of the Serverless Framework implementation:
  - Define services in `serverless.yml` files
  - Utilize plugins for extended functionality (e.g., serverless-offline for local testing)
  - Implement environment-specific configurations
  - Use custom resources for any AWS resources not natively supported by the framework
- Implement CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline or a third-party tool like GitLab CI or GitHub Actions
- Create separate environments for development, staging, and production
- Use Serverless Framework's built-in support for staging to manage different environments

## 7. Local Development

- Use the Serverless Offline plugin to emulate AWS Lambda and API Gateway locally
- Utilize LocalStack for emulating other AWS services not covered by Serverless Offline
- Provide Docker Compose setup for local deployment of supporting services (e.g., DynamoDB local)
- Include sample data and test scenarios in the repository
- Implement environment variables for configurable settings

## 8. Testing Strategy

### 8.1 Unit Testing

- Implement unit tests for individual Lambda functions
- Use mocking libraries to isolate dependencies
- Aim for high code coverage (e.g., >80%)

### 8.2 Integration Testing

- Develop integration tests for API endpoints
- Test interactions between different components (e.g., Lambda to DynamoDB)
- Use AWS SAM Local or Serverless Offline for local integration testing

### 8.3 End-to-End Testing

- Implement end-to-end tests covering critical user journeys
- Use tools like Cypress or Selenium for UI testing
- Consider implementing contract tests for external integrations

### 8.4 Performance Testing

- Conduct load tests to ensure the system can handle expected traffic
- Use tools like Apache JMeter or AWS Load Testing service
- Monitor and optimize based on performance test results

### 8.5 Security Testing

- Perform regular security scans and penetration testing
- Use tools like OWASP ZAP for automated security testing
- Conduct manual security reviews of critical components

## 9. Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI
- Create and maintain a comprehensive README file for the project repository
- Document deployment procedures and environment setup
- Maintain a change log to track system modifications and updates
- Create user manuals for different user roles (e.g., loan officers, system administrators)

## 10. Training and Support

- Develop training materials for internal users (e.g., loan officers, underwriters)
- Create a knowledge base for common issues and their resolutions
- Implement a ticketing system for tracking and resolving user issues
- Establish a process for regular system updates and user communication
